## Introduction to R Programming

<img src="assets/img/rprog.png" alt="Workshop Title Slide" width="720">

R has a powerful suite of high-level statistical functions, but sometimes you need lower-level control over the functionality of your script. No prior knowledge of R is required. In this workshop, you will learn how to write programs in R using functions and control flow. We will cover variables, data types, functions, conditional blocks, loops, and debugging.

**The materials for this workshop are available here:** https://scds.github.io/intro-r/
