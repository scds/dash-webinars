## Introduction to R Programming

<img src="assets/img/rprog.png" alt="Workshop Title Slide" width="720">

R has a powerful suite of high-level statistical functions, but sometimes you need lower-level control over the functionality of your script. In this workshop, you will learn how to write programs in R using functions and control flow. We will cover functions, conditional blocks, loops, and debugging.Â 

Presentation by Isaac Kinley, DASH Support Assistant and PhD Candidate in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Behaviour.
