Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. This workshop will cover topics such as applications of data analysis basics for visualizations; effective designs of basic charts such as pie charts, bar charts, and scatterplots; time series analysis and visualization; and more advanced analytical displays like bar-in-bar, slope charts, dot plots, and bullet charts. 

A basic working knowledge of MS Excel is required for this workshop.
