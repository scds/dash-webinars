# Cleaning Up Messy Data with Python and Pandas

Raw data often require special preparation for efficient statistical analyses and visualization. This workshop will introduce useful Python functionality along with the pandas package to help organize your raw data and create a clean dataset. Participants will learn how to read multiple CSV files, filter and manipulate their data, and then combine them into a single dataframe according to best practices.Â 

Presentation by Maya Flannery (DASH Support Assistant). Please note that a beginner-level understand of Python is required for this workshop.
