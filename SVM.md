## Machine Learning with R: SVM Classification

<img src="assets/img/SVM.png" alt="Workshop Title Slide" width="720">

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. This workshop will only cover the theoretical and practical parts of SVM classification as SVM is mostly used in classification problems. After the introduction, participants will receive hands-on training in the implementation of SVM classification in R, as well as training and testing datasets and setting up tuning and kernal parameters. 

Presentation by Shaila Jamal, DASH Support Assistant and PhD Candidate in Earth, Environment, and Society.
