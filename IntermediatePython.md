Python is a powerful and easy-to-learn programming language used by many scientists. From web scraping to bioinformatics, Python is bound to have a module that could be useful to you. This workshop will include a brief review of variable types and control flow before moving on to functions, variable scope, object-oriented programming, and several of Python’s important science libraries.

*Presented by Isaac Kinley (DASH Support Assistant). This virtual workshop will be recorded and shared publicly on the Sherman Centre's website.
