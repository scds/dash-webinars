# Machine Learning with R: K-Means Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning approach for finding subgroups of observations within a data set. This workshop will introduce participants to the theoretical part of the most common clustering method, K-means clustering. Afterwards, participants will gain hands-on experience in how to conduct K-means clustering in R, as well as how to interpret and visualize their results. 

Presentation by Shaila Jamal, DASH Support Assistant and PhD Candidate in Earth, Environment, and Society.

This event is run in collaboration with the YWCA's Uplift Program, which supports women and non-binary people re-skilling to enter the tech industry.
